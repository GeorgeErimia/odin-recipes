    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cabbage rolls recipe is super easy to prep with cabbage leaves, ground beef, rice, and condensed tomato soup. I have been using this recipe for well over 20 years and still love it! To speed things up the rolls are cooked in a skillet on the stovetop but this recipe also works well in a slow cooker.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rice</b>: These stuffed cabbage rolls start with white rice.</li>
        <li><b>Cabbage leaves</b>: This recipe serves eight, so it calls for eight cabbage leaves. </li>
        <li><b>Beef</b>: Youâ€™ll need a pound of ground beef. You can substitute ground turkey if you prefer. </li>
        <li><b>Onion</b>: Chopped onion lends flavor and texture to the filling. </li>
        <li><b>Egg</b>: An egg gives the filling moisture and helps hold the mixture together. </li>
        <li><b>Canned soup</b>: A can of condensed tomato soup is the convenient secret ingredient. </li>
        <li><b>Seasonings</b>: The cabbage roll filling is simply seasoned with salt and pepper. </li>
    </ul>
